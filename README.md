# R - Functions, Cleaning, Analysis and Sharing (FxCAs)
![v2 0](https://github.com/fendit/FxCAs/assets/37236930/70916215-32f1-4b89-bae0-a907e50d0c9b)

### Introduction
In this repository, I present a multiple-script-interconnected, minimalistic framework that facilitates data cleaning and analysis in R. This framework (which I called ‘Functions, Cleaning, Analysis and Sharing’, or ‘FxCAs’) is based on the idea of ‘Division of Labor’. Please visit [v1.0](https://github.com/fendit/FxCAs/tree/v1.0) for more information.

### What's New

#### sharing.R
- Allows user to share all three R scripts and other files from a local directory to one or more remote directories automatically with custom commands
